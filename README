Hi
This is just the read me for my janken, rock, paper, scissor game.
It's pretty simple and straight forward
It was one of the projects on the Foundations Odin projects course.
I might incorporate this into another project, it could add a fun twist!
Had fun building ThisThe most difficult part was the comaprisions
I felt like I was cheating by declaring one the winner over the other, just cause I say scissor
But that's power I guess
And that's how rules are made.
